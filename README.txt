Group Members: Blake Erickson, Christian LaPlante, Malcom Chaney.
Project Goal: We used a .csv file containing information about the weather from the time between July 2015 and April 2016 and comparing it to information gathered from Malcolm's wife's Fitbit during that time. 
The dots show precipitation in inches, the black bars show either the steps or hours slept, and the red/blue lines show the max and min temperatures respectively. The data in the third window is calculated based on the entire
dataset unless there is a section highlighted, in which case it will calculate based on that.

Controls: By default, the window displays the hours slept. To change the data shown to steps, press the up or down arrow. To highlight a section of the data and show it in more detail, click and drag in the first window.
